## 🌑 About The Project
Forever Jung is an AI-powered companion for Shadow Work and Individuation. Unlike standard chatbots, it uses a 'Council of Guides' architecture to provide distinct philosophical perspectives (Jungian, Stoic, Somatic) rather than generic advice.

**Note:** This is an educational tool for self-reflection, not a medical device.

## ✨ Key Methodology
* **The Wise Sage:** Pattern recognition & Dream Analysis (Jungian).
* **The Stoic Architect:** Resilience & Dichotomy of Control (Stoicism).
* **The Grounded Guide:** Somatic awareness & Breathwork (Mindfulness).
* **The Alchemist's Vault:** Zero-knowledge encryption for user journals.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** React + Vite
* **UI:** Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
* **AI:** Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via API)
* **Deployment:** Vercel
